# Iris-Classification

The Iris classification task involves using TensorFlow and scikit-learn to build a machine learning model.
With scikit-learn, one can preprocess and split the Iris dataset into training and testing sets.
TensorFlow, a deep learning library, facilitates the creation of a neural network for classification. 
The model is trained on the training set, optimizing weights using backpropagation. Evaluation on the test set assesses its performance.
TensorBoard can visualize the training process. The synergy of scikit-learn's simplicity for data handling and TensorFlow's power for deep learning allows effective development and deployment of an accurate Iris classification model.
